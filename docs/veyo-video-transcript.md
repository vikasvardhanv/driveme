## Introduction

Welcome to Veyo's driver app training video. Today we will demonstrate the Veyo driver app. Our app was built to make trip assignment, trip completion, and trip finalization easy for providers and their drivers, dramatically reducing administrative burdens and helping to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.

The app streams dispatched from the Veyo provider portal directly to drivers' phones in real-time. Drivers can use their smartphone or tablet to view all of their trips for the day, review special trip instructions, access navigation using their preferred app, and capture and finalize trip data automatically.

Once the trip is complete, the trip is automatically submitted for billing and payment arrives the following week. Please note that all members and protected health information shown in this demo are fictitious.

## Part 1: Dispatching Trips to Drivers (Provider Portal)

Let's begin with how to dispatch trips to your drivers. To start, you must first accept trips in the provider portal. Begin by logging into the provider portal at **providers.veyo.com** and going to the **Accept Trips** tab.

Once your trips have been accepted, you can now go to the **Assign Trips to Drivers** tab. There are two ways to assign trips to drivers:
1. You can either assign trips directly through the portal
2. Or you can upload trip assignments through an Excel spreadsheet

### Method 1: Direct Portal Assignment

Let's look at the first option. To assign trips through the portal, start with the date filter. Select the date or range of dates for which you would like to assign trips.

Now that you have some trips selected, you can assign a driver to them. Look at the **driver column** of the trip grid and click on the box that prompts you to enter driver name. Select a driver by entering his or her name or driver ID number, or by selecting them in the drop-down menu.

Once you have selected a driver, the trip will **automatically be sent to the driver's phone** running the Veyo driver app.

### Method 2: Excel Spreadsheet Upload

The second method of assigning trips is through an Excel spreadsheet. Again, begin by checking the date filter and selecting the date or range of dates for which you would like to assign trips.

Then click the **green Export button** at the top right to download an Excel file containing the trips that need to be assigned. You can assign trips to drivers in the Excel sheet by clicking on the cells in the driver column and using the drop-down menu to populate each cell with drivers. **Make sure to save your Excel sheet once you're finished.**

Once all of the drivers have been populated, upload the Excel sheet to the portal by clicking the **yellow Upload button** at the top right corner. The portal will then display a summary of all trips that have been assigned:
- Trips that are assigned correctly will say **"Pending"**
- Incorrectly assigned trips will say **"Failed"**

To fix incorrectly assigned trips, download the error file by clicking **Download Import Results File** and try the assignments again after making changes. Upload the file again.

When all the assignments are made, review the import summary that shows the number of trips each driver was assigned. If it is incorrect, go back to the Assign Trips to Drivers tab and correct any mistakes. If the assignments are correct, click **Confirm**.

Once trips have been assigned to drivers, the portal will automatically send the trips to the drivers' phones that are running the Veyo driver app. **You have now completed the trip dispatch process.**

## Part 2: Driver App Setup & Login

Now we will move on to using the driver app. You'll require several documents and pieces of information to create app accounts for each driver:
- A list of drivers for each provider company with individual emails and phone numbers
- A list of the company's vehicles
- Copies of the vehicle registration, insurance, and inspection forms

You can check for device compatibility at **partner.veyo.com/app**.

To log into the driver app, the driver will enter their email address or phone number. Their initial temporary password is set by Veyo. To change the password, click **Forgot Password** and enter the email address associated with the driver's account. They will receive an email with instructions to change the password.

**Be sure to enable push notifications on the drivers' devices so that they will receive real-time trip updates and notifications.**

## Part 3: Overview & Vehicle Selection

Once the driver logs into the app, start by checking the **Overview of assigned trips**. If no trips have been assigned, "No trip overview available" will be displayed. Press the **refresh button** at the top right of the screen frequently to show any newly assigned trips.

Suppose the driver is ready to start driving for the day and has reviewed the trips for the day. Once they press **Start Taking Trips**, it will prompt them to log in with the vehicle they're driving.

Enter the first few digits of the license plate or vehicle number and select the correct vehicle from the drop-down. The **Confirm Vehicle** screen will show the vehicle information including the vehicle make/model and ask the driver to confirm that it is correct.

If the wrong vehicle has been selected, press **Wrong Vehicle** to go back and select a different one.

## Part 4: Schedule & Begin Pickup

After the driver confirms their vehicle, we'll go to the **Schedule page** showing all trips for the day in time order.

When the driver is ready to drive to the first pickup location, they should **swipe from left to right on Begin Pickup** and confirm.

A **Trip Instructions pop-up** will prompt the driver to confirm trip or member-specific information. **These instructions are important, so please read them carefully.** After reading the instructions, **check all of the boxes** and hit **Confirm**.

For additional information on a trip, press the icon that looks like **three dots** at the top-right corner of the screen.

## Part 5: Navigation & Pickup

You can select a GPS navigation app of your choice by hitting the **arrow icon** on the bottom right. The apps that will be shown depend on what the driver has installed on their device. **Veyo uses Google Maps to determine trip distances and fares.**

Upon arrival at the pickup location for the first member, the driver once again **swipes left to right on Arrived at Pickup**.

The driver should then:
1. Call the member
2. Meet them at the door
3. Assist them into the vehicle
4. Provide any additional assistance specified in the trip instructions

**If the member does not answer their phone, they must be sure to knock on the door and wait at least 5 minutes after arriving or after the scheduled pickup, whichever is later.**

If the driver is at the wrong location, a pop-up will notify them that they are more than one mile away.

After the member is safely in the vehicle, **swipe left to right on Pickup is Done** and proceed to the drop-off location.

As always, the driver should keep conversation light and neutral. **Avoid topics such as religion, politics, and members' personal lives.**

---

## Part 6: Drop-off & Trip Completion

After arriving at the drop-off location, the driver should assist the member out of the vehicle and to the door, following any special trip instructions.

After the member has been safely dropped off, **swipe from left to right on Drop-off is Done**.

When a trip is complete, it will appear in the **Done Trips section** at the bottom of the Schedule as well as the bottom of the Trip Overview.

## Part 7: Additional Features

### Canceling a Trip

The Veyo driver app has several additional features, such as the ability to cancel a trip.

To cancel a trip:
1. Press the **three dots icon** to view the trip details
2. Press the **Options button** at the top right of the screen
3. After pressing **Cancel Trip**, choose from the list of reasons for the cancellation
4. Type a detailed description of why the trip was canceled

**Veyo reviews this information, so please be as accurate as possible.**

### Multi-Loading (Multiple Passengers)

If you are multi-loading members in your vehicle, just swipe:
- Begin Pickup
- Arrived at Pickup
- Pickup is Done
- Drop-off is Done

...for each member **in the same order** in which they are being picked up and dropped off.

**Be sure to swipe at the correct time and location for each member to avoid problems with the trip data or app.**

### ⚠️ Fraud Prevention Warning

**Also make sure that drivers do NOT swipe through all of the stages of the trip at once. If they do this, the trip data may look fraudulent and will be flagged for investigation.**

### Accident/Incident Reports

You can also access Veyo's **accident and incident report form** directly from the app.
